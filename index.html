            <p id="intro-paragraph">Hello, I'm Kalelo Dukuray, a computer science major currently enrolled at BMCC. I'm excited to share that I'll be graduating this semester, and my aspirations are set on pursuing further studies at the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology. As someone of Gambian descent, I've had the privilege of spending a significant portion of my life in West Africa, where I had the opportunity to immerse myself in my cultural heritage, traditions, and the rich tapestry of my ancestry. My interests have always revolved around the world of mathematics, computer science, and the fascinating realm of cryptography. Looking ahead, my ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of open-source software that safeguards individuals' privacy and fundamental human rights. I firmly believe that technology holds the key to our future, and I advocate for everyone to acquire at least a basic understanding of programming. While not everyone may become a software developer, learning a programming language equips individuals with computational thinking skills and problem-solving abilities, which are increasingly essential in our modern-day lives.</p>
