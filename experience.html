            <p id="intro-paragraph">While I may not have formal work experience in the field as a web developer or software developer, I consider myself far from a newcomer to the world of software development. My journey into programming began in 2020 when my cousin introduced me to the fascinating realm of coding. Shortly after, I acquired a laptop and took it upon myself to delve into basic scripting using Python, a language that has since become my comfort zone. It wasn't until I embarked on my associates degree program at BMCC that I began taking programming seriously. Over the past 18 months, I've seized numerous opportunities to expand my skills, explore various programming languages, and create projects I'm genuinely proud of. Among my accomplishments is the development of a portfolio website, crafted using Python, JavaScript (React), HTML, and CSS, as well as a desktop application I designed as part of my honors project, utilizing C++. While my professional journey is just beginning, my passion for software development and my growing skill set drive me toward a promising future in the field.</p>
